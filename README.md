# MOOC-Helsinki

THis is my approach to some of the excercises from widely recommended and free to use JAVA course created by University of Helsinki.

I don't intend to copy solutions to every excercise due to fact that many of them are mere syntax repetition. 
While this kind of practice is crucial for any aspiring developer, it fails to show skills of person writing them. 
Therefore I'm going to concentrate on the "Write as you like" excercises form second part of the course (Weeks 7 to 12).

Feel free to comment.
